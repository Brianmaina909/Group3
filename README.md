# Group3 - House Sales in King County, USA - Multiple Regression Model
**Introduction**
The objective of this project is to develop a linear regression model for the House Sales in King County, USA dataset. The purpose of regression analysis is to determine if a set of predictor variables effectively predicts an outcome variable and to identify which variables significantly influence the outcome variable.

Linear Regression Analysis involves three stages: analyzing data correlation and directionality, estimating the model by fitting the line, and evaluating the model's validity and usefulness.

**Stage 1: Data Preprocessing and EDA**
Import the dataset and perform data preprocessing, including handling null values and changing data types.
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify correlations within the data.

**Stage 2: Model Creation**
Create a base model and abstract classes.
Define the LinearModel class as a subclass of the base model.
Implement the least squares and least mean squares linear regression classes.
Initialize the models and create methods for training the data.

**Stage 3: Model Validation**
Generate plots to visualize the predicted line and assess the model's validity.
Verify the model using least mean square and least squares with various data.
